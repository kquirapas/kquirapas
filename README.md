# ðŸ‘´ Hey I'm Kristian, I build distributed and decentralized systems in Rust

# Mission
I'm on a mission to drive breakthroughs in humanity by serving the world with one technological innovation at a time quantified by a **minimum of 1 Billion USD worth of tech shipped to the world for good**.

# My Current Focus
I'm building toward a vision of a "world computer" built on top of a democratic web, where we render the resources of the world to solve each other's problems.
