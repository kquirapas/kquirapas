`# **Shaping the human experience with web-scale, distributed, and decentralized systems.**

# Mission ðŸ¦€
I'm on a mission to drive breakthroughs in humanity by serving the world with one technological innovation at a time quantified by a **minimum of 1 Billion USD worth of tech shipped to the world for good**.

# My Current Focus ðŸ¦€
I'm building toward a vision of a "world computer" built on top of a democratic web, where we render the world's resources to solve each other's problems. 

Presently: `Local-First Systems`, `DePIN`, `Distributed Systems`, `P2P Networking`, and `Node architecture`.
