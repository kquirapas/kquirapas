#### Guiding Principles

> Wide in perspective but deep in skill.

> I'd rather be the stupid one in the room. I can be certain that I'll come out wiser.

> Easy money sounds nice, but I'd rather have wealth-building as a part of my being and not just a function of luck.

> I can learn anything. I can master anything. I just have to give it enough time and effort.

> If I can't see the solution, then clearly there is some learning to be done.
