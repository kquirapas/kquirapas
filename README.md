### Fun facts

> Neo(VIM) is life

> I'd rather be the stupidest person in the room. It's an indicator that I'm in the right place for growth and learning.

> I started learning how to code when I was in elementary. We had no internet and I wanted to find a way for my classmates to have fun by creating a game with notepad. (Yes, batch files.)

> I used to be a generalist (jack of all trades) which gives me a lot of horizontal perspective on building software.
