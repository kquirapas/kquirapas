# Mission ðŸ¦€
I'm on a mission to drive breakthroughs in humanity by serving the world with one technological innovation at a time, quantified by a **minimum of 1 Billion USD worth of tech shipped to the world for good**.

# My Current Focus ðŸ¦€
I'm heavily invested in working with network performance bottlenecks, building data pipelines, and solving complex data problems in decentralized infrastructure and protocols.

Presently: `Local-First Systems`, `Rollups`, `Layer2`, `DePIN`, `Distributed Systems`, `P2P Networking`, `Node Architecture`. and `Compute Over Data`

# Software Engineering Details ðŸ¦€
- **17 years** of tech
- **12 years** professionally
- **4 years** of Rust ðŸ¦€
- **4 years** of Solana
- **4 years** of Ethereum (EVM)
