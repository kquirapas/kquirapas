# Mission
I'm on a mission to drive breakthroughs in humanity by serving the world with one technological innovation at a time.

I'm quantifying the achievement of this mission with a minimum 1 Billion USD worth of tech shipped to the world for good.

# My Current Focus
I'm in the abyss of designing and engineering scalable, crash/byzantine fault-tolerant, open, secure, and distributed systems with the `Rust` programming language.
